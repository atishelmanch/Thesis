The history of particle physics encompasses a slew of discoveries of fundamental particles and force mediators that describe the matter and interactions of the universe. While much has been theorized and experimentally verified, the story of particle physics is far from over. As we progress, theoretical and experimental results will continue to influence other with the goal of understanding the nature of the universe. In this chapter, the current theoretical foundation of particle physics will be described in order to motivate the experimental setup and physics analyses later described in this thesis.

This chapter is structured as follows: The most successful theoretical model of particle physics to date, the standard model, will be described in Section \ref{sec:SM}. In Section \ref{sec:Higgs}, the Higgs boson and its corresponding electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism will be described. Finally, Section \ref{sec:Higgs_Pair_Production} will describe the process of Higgs pair production.
