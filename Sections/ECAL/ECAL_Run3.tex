While a search for Higgs pair production in the two W boson, two photon state has been performed with the LHC Run 2 dataset, it is important for CMS to continue optimizing its data-taking algorithms in order to improve this and other analysis sensitivities that will use the LHC Run 3 dataset. During LS2, the CMS ECAL trigger algorithms used during Run 2 were further developed and optimized. Additionally, there have been ongoing investigations and testing of new features of the CMS ECAL trigger for Run 3. In order for the CMS ECAL to properly operate and test these new features, a variety of operations teams are required.

This Chapter is organized as follows: In Section \ref{sec:ECAL_TPG}, the method of ECAL Trigger Primitive Generation as input to the CMS L1 trigger, and a re-optimization of its energy reconstruction algorithm for Run 3 will be described. In Section \ref{sec:DW}, the development and commissioning of a new ECAL feature known as ``Double Weights", targeting deployment during Run 3, will be described. In Section \ref{sec:ECAL_Operations}, the various ECAL operations teams and their responsibilities, vital for the successful commissioning and operation of the CMS ECAL for Run 3, will be described.
