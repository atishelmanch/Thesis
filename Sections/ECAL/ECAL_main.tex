\chapter{The CMS Electromagnetic Calorimeter}\label{chapter:ECAL}

The CMS Electromagnetic Calorimeter is the second layer of the CMS detector, with respect to the interaction point of collisions produced by the LHC. In this Chapter, the CMS ECAL will first be introduced in Section \ref{sec:ECAL_Introduction}. In Section \ref{sec:ECAL_TPG}, the method of ECAL Trigger Primitive Generation as input to the CMS L1 trigger will be described. In Section \ref{sec:DW}, the development and commissioning of a new ECAL feature known as ``Double Weights" will be described, and in Section \ref{sec:ECAL_Operations} the various ECAL operations teams and their responsibilities will be described.
