\subsection{Fully-Hadronic} \label{subsec:FullyHadronicEventSelection}

Data and simulation events fall into the Fully-hadronic category if they contain at least 4 jets satisfying the conditions described in Section \ref{sec:Jets}, and at least one diphoton candidate satisfying the selections described in Section \ref{sec:photons}. To maintain categorical orthogonality with the Semi-leptonic and Fully-leptonic final states, events in the Fully-hadronic category are required to have exactly zero leptons passing the
selections described in Section \ref{sec:LeptonSelections}. 

Because the invariant mass resolution of two jets is not expected to be precise enough to separate W-boson and Z-boson events, the Fully-Hadronic $HH \rightarrow ZZ\gamma\gamma$
channel is expected to overlap with the Fully-hadronic $HH \rightarrow WW\gamma\gamma$ channel. In addition, the HH$\rightarrow$bb$\gamma\gamma$ process is difficult to distinguish from the Fully-hadronic HH$\rightarrow$VV$\gamma\gamma$ signatures. In order to optimize this final state analysis for the Fully-hadronic WW$\gamma\gamma$ final state, a dedicated ``bb$\gamma\gamma$ killer'' DNN is trained to differentiate HH$\rightarrow$bb$\gamma\gamma$ from all backgrounds. After the removal of these additional final states, any remaining events are included in the signal definition.
Therefore, in the final signal definition, $HH \rightarrow ZZ\gamma\gamma \rightarrow qqqq\gamma\gamma$, $HH \rightarrow bb\gamma\gamma$ and $HH \rightarrow WW\gamma\gamma \rightarrow qqqq\gamma\gamma$ are included. Thus, the Fully-Hadronic signal corresponds to $HH \rightarrow (WW + ZZ + bb) \gamma \gamma$. 

% Note, that we applied bb$\gamma \gamma$ killer cut before adding bb$\gamma \gamma$ signal.

% To avoid the overlap consideration, the $HH \rightarrow ZZ\gamma\gamma \rightarrow qqqq\gamma\gamma$
% process is included in the analysis' signal definition.
% Therefore, the Fully-Hadronic signal corresponds to $HH \rightarrow (WW + ZZ)\gamma\gamma \rightarrow qqqq\gamma\gamma$.

% Because the WW and ZZ yields are combined, the fullyhadronic selections described above and in this section are applied to both the WW and ZZ signal samples.

% As a combination is foreseen with all nonresonant HH channels, including bb$\gamma\gamma$, it is ideal to minimize the number of bb$\gamma\gamma$ events falling into both analysis phase spaces as much as possible, to reduce
% the likelihood that data events pass both analysis selections.

% This is because if data events fall into both analysis phase spaces, they must be handled appropriately in the
% combination, otherwise the events would be incorrectly double counted when deriving a combined result. 

\subsubsection{DNN for Fully-Hadronic Channel}
\label{subsubsec:FullyHadronicDNN}
As mentioned in Section \ref{sec:Strategy}, a DNN approach must be taken for the Fully-hadronic final state to optimize sensitivity, while simultaneously minimizing
contamination from the $HH \rightarrow (bb + ZZ)\gamma\gamma$ processes. To this end, two binary trainings are performed as follows:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{WW$\gamma\gamma$ identifier}: Trained for the separation of signal ($HH \rightarrow WW\gamma\gamma$) and backgrounds listed in Tab.~\ref{tab:fullyHadronicMCBkg}).
  \item \textbf{bb$\gamma\gamma$ killer}: Trained in order to obtain a discriminant to use for reducing the contamination of bb$\gamma\gamma$. For this training, bb$\gamma\gamma$ is considered signal,
  and the MC listed in Tab.~\ref{tab:fullyHadronicMCBkg}, with the addition of the WW$\gamma\gamma$ process, are considered background.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{WW$\gamma\gamma$ identifier}

This binary DNN training is used for the separation of di-Higgs (WW$\gamma\gamma$) signal w.r.t. background. The backgrounds used for the Fully-Hadronic
training is shown in Tab.~\ref{tab:fullyHadronicMCBkg}.

From the list of background considered in Tab.~\ref{tab:fullyHadronicMCBkg}, QCD simulation suffers from a very low number of events, so a data-driven approach is considered for estimating the QCD. The considered data-driven approach estimates QCD and $\gamma$+jets simultaneously. This is described in sec.~\ref{subsubsec:QCDDataDriven}.

This DNN is trained using 2017 signal and background MC, and is evaluated on the signal and data of each data-taking year. The sum of three EFT benchmark simulation samples generated at LO (nodes 1, 2 and 3 as defined in Table \ref{tab:eft_bench}) is considered as signal in MC training, and is reweighted to the SM HH signal and NLO as was done in the Semi-leptonic case. The dominant background processes, namely $\gamma\gamma+$jets and QCD are used as background for training the network.

% The events used to train the network are required to pass the common di-Photon pre-selection described in Sec.~\ref{sec:commomSel} 

In order to produced a data-driven estimate of QCD$+\gamma$jet, data events in the sideband with an additional selection on photon ID of $<$ -0.7 is applied to the leading and subleading photons. Therefore, events used for the Fully-hadronic DNN training are required to have a photon ID score $>$ -0.7. 

% along with the photon ID $>$ -0.7 (for both leading and subleading photons), contains exactly zero leptons passing the common lepton selections in Sec.~\ref{sec:LeptonSelections}, at least 4 jets in Sec.~\ref{subsec:Jets}.

The features used as input to the Fully-Hadronic channel DNN can be found in Tab.~\ref{tab:FHDNNinputfeatures1} and Tab.~\ref{tab:FHDNNinputfeatures2}.

\subsubsection{bb$\gamma\gamma$ killer}

This binary DNN training is used as a bb$\gamma\gamma$ killer. The objective of this DNN is to output a bb$\gamma\gamma$ killer score to use as a discriminant to use for the removal of bb$\gamma\gamma$ events from the WW$\gamma\gamma$ phase-space. This is trained considering a bb$\gamma\gamma$ simulation sample as signal. The list of background used consists of all background mentioned in Tab.~\ref{tab:fullyHadronicMCBkg} along with the Fully-hadronic WW$\gamma\gamma$ simulation sample. Other details for this training including the events selections, list of input variables and DNN architecture remain the same as for the WW$\gamma\gamma$ identifier described in Section \ref{subsubsec:FullyHadronicDNN}. 

% The correlation between all the input features are checked and shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:FH_DNN_CorrelationPlot_bbggVsAll}. For some of input features there are large correlations but for DNN it should not affect the result. So, variables having large correlations are not removed.
