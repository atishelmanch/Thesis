\section{Summary} \label{sec:Phase_II_Summary}

A projection of the sensitivity of non-resonant Higgs boson pair production in the WW$\gamma\gamma$ and \ttgg final states has been performed, using simulated proton-proton collision events at a center-of-mass energy of 14 TeV and integrated luminosity of 3000 fb$^{-1}$ at the future HL-LHC. Additionally, the response of the future Phase II CMS detector has been simulated. For the \wwgg and one tau \ttgg final states of this analysis, the analysis strategy and techniques from the Run 2 \wwgg analysis are used. 

Combining all final state categories and including systematic uncertainties, a combined expected significance of $0.22$ $\sigma$ is measured.

When considering a projection analysis, it is important consider a few caveats to the result. The first is that because the analysis is simulation only, it is not possible to make the use of data-driven techniques, such as the one used for the Fully-hadronic final state of the Run 2 \wwgg analysis. Additionally, as the HL-LHC and Phase II CMS detector have not yet been assembled, physicists have not yet had a chance to study this new detector's response to new data-taking conditions. Such studies can often include the optimization of the detector's ability to identify particles, and thus can lead to improved identification and analysis sensitivity.
