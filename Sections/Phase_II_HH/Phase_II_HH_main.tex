In addition to analyzing data already taken by the CMS detector during LHC Run 2, and further developing the detector's data-taking features to improve physics sensitivity during LHC Run 3, it is important to perform projection studies in order to estimate the expected sensitivity to physics processes with future particle accelerators and upgraded detectors. These studies provide physicists with initial insight of what to expect when performing future measurements and searches, and can motivate which analyses to perform in the future.

Through the results of the search for di-Higgs production in the WW$\gamma\gamma$ final state using the LHC Run 2 dataset, it is difficult to obtain an accurate estimate of the analysis sensitivity at the future HL-LHC with the upgraded CMS detector. In order to perform this projection, a separate simulation-only analysis is performed. In addition, the \ttgg HH final state is added to this search as it has a similar final state topology to \wwgg. 

The structure of this chapter is as follows: The strategy of the analysis will be described in Section \ref{sec:Strategy_Phase_II}. The phase II CMS detector will be described in Section \ref{section:Phase_II_CMS}. The simulated samples used in this analysis will be described in Section \ref{sec:Phase_II_Samples}. Object selection is described in Section \ref{sec:Phase_II_ObjectSel}. Event selection and categorization will be described in Section \ref{sec:Phase_II_Selections}. A description of the systematic uncertainties considered is described in Section \ref{sec:Phase_II_Systematics}. The results of the analysis are presented in Section \ref{sec:Phase_II_results}, and the analysis is summarized in Section \ref{sec:Phase_II_Summary}.
