During Run 2, the muon system of CMS was composed of three sub-detectors whose information was combined in order to optimize muon reconstruction. These three sub-detectors are the Cathode Strip Chambers, the Resistive Plate Chambers, and the Drift Tubes described in Sections \ref{sec:CSC}, \ref{sec:RPC} and \ref{sec:DT} respectively. During LS2, the installation of a new muon system called the Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) was completed in order to improve muon identification through the addition of additional measurements. This new sub-detector is currently being commissioning for LHC Run 3. A diagram including all CMS muon subsystems, as of the beginning of LHC Run 3, is shown in Figure \ref{fig:MuonSystem}.
