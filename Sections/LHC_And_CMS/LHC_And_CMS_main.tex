From the theoretical background described in the previous chapter, we know what type of physics we expect to see given an initial set of conditions. In order to test the consistency of this theory and search for its expected signatures in order to answer fundamental questions, we require an experimental setup designed to produce and study these physical interactions. 

This chapter is divided into two sections: Section \ref{sec:LHC} will describe the Large Hadron Collider, and Section \ref{sec:CMS} will describe the Compact Muon Solenoid detector.
